# Test things:

Start by testing the Grammar package

# Migrate the Lexer into the lex package

Write up the low level helper functions for the lexer

Add them together to get progressively closer to completing
the lexer

Test everything as you go

# Correct the imports in the parsing package

# Update the toolchain to use Go 1.9 beta 

This is to allow the use of sync.Map and type aliasing.

# Implement the main.go function
